# Diabetes-Prediction-using-SVM
This project aims to build a predictive system using ml to determine whether a person has diabetes based on various diagnostic measurements. The system utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on the PIMA Diabetes Dataset, a well-known dataset for this classification problem.
