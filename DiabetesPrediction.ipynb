SVMs are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and can use various kernel functions to handle non-linear relationships in the data, making them suitable for complex datasets like the PIMA Diabetes Dataset. A linear kernel is initially used for simplicity and interpretability.\n",

SVMs are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and can use various kernel functions to handle non-linear relationships in the data, making them suitable for complex datasets like the PIMA Diabetes Dataset.
